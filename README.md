# Python - Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock

Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, 
Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla

"Spock" is signified with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the 
hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned 
by lizard and disproven by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock 
and decapitated by scissors.

As beginner, I wrote this hand game as part of a project for my studies.
